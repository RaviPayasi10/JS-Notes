    <!-- Since script file is blocking in nature normally, after rendering list item 1
    it will stop the UI rendering of 3, it will first load and execute the script file
    and after that completes, it will render the 3rd list item. 
    This is not optimal as it will make UI uninteractive

    To prevent this, we can use two attributes called Async and Defer.

    ASYNC - If this attribute is used, the fetching of script will be done
    asynchronously/parallely with html parsing. After fetching is complete,
    then it start execution of script. This execution of script is still 
    blocking in nature, so it will pause the parsing of html file and first
    execute the script, after execution it will resume the parsing of html file.

    Order of execution for Async - If multiple script files are there, async will not
    maintain any order for their execution. Any file can executed before any other file
    depending upon their completion.

    DEFER - In this, fetching of script file will be done parallely with parsing
    of html file. Then after the parsing of html is complete, then it will start
    executing the script file.
    So, it parses parallely but executes after html is completely parsed.
    Order of execution - If multiple script files are present, then defer maintains
    the order of execution of files in the order in which they are called.
